## Notes

Getting the API call was a challenge for me. I forgot to add conditional rendering, so I was stuck for a while on why my data kept returning null. I realized that I was trying to render the data before my API could retrieve it so that was a hassle. Also, getting the pie chart to work was also challenging. The lab helped me a lot with learning how to route between pages.
